# 🚀 Terraform on Azure: Provision a Linux VM

This isn’t just a Terraform lab — it’s the power of **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** in action.  
With a few lines of HCL and one `terraform apply`, I can bring an entire Azure environment to life:

- Resource Group  
- Virtual Network + Subnet  
- Network Security Group with secure rules  
- Public IP + NIC  
- Storage Account for boot diagnostics  
- Ubuntu Linux Virtual Machine with SSH access  

💡 **Why it matters**:  
I learned how to transform manual, repetitive clicks on Azure Portal into reproducible, automated, and auditable code. This means faster deployments, fewer errors, and infrastructure that grows as projects scale.  

Next steps: turning this into reusable **modules**, adding **VM Scale Sets**, and enabling **Monitoring + Application Gateway**.
